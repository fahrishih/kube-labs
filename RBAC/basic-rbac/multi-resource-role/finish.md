# Congratulations!

You have successfully completed the Role With Multiple Resource Permissions scenario.

## What you've learned:

- How to create a Role with different permissions for multiple resources
- How to use different verb sets for different resources
- How to use the wildcard verb (`*`) to grant full access to a resource
- How to verify permissions across different resource types

## Next Steps:

- Explore ClusterRoles for granting permissions across all namespaces
- Learn about aggregated ClusterRoles to reuse and combine permissions
- Implement RBAC with service accounts for your applications
- Study RBAC best practices for securing your Kubernetes cluster

Understanding how to properly configure RBAC with targeted permissions for different resources is crucial for maintaining the security principle of least privilege in your Kubernetes clusters.
