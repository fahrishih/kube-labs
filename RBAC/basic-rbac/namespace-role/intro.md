# Namespace-Scoped Role and RoleBinding Challenge

In this challenge, you'll apply your knowledge of RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) in Kubernetes by creating namespace-scoped Roles and RoleBindings.

## Your Challenge:

You need to configure RBAC to allow a user named `pod-reader` to have read-only access to pods in a specific namespace, while ensuring they cannot access other resources or perform other actions.

The challenge will test your understanding of:
- Creating namespace-scoped Roles with specific permissions
- Binding Roles to users with RoleBindings
- Testing and verifying RBAC permissions

A testing environment has already been set up with a namespace and some running pods. Your task is to implement the proper RBAC controls.

Good luck!
