# Congratulations!

You have successfully completed the Namespace-Scoped Role and RoleBinding challenge.

## What you've learned:

- How to create a namespace-scoped Role for read-only pod access
- How to create a RoleBinding to assign permissions to a user
- How to verify and test RBAC permissions
- The scope and limitations of namespace-bound Roles

## Challenge Recap:

In this challenge, you:
1. Created a Role that allowed read-only access to pods in the rbac-test namespace
2. Created a RoleBinding that connected the pod-reader user to the Role
3. Verified that the permissions worked correctly and were appropriately restricted

## Next Challenges:

- Try creating Roles with permissions for different resources or with different verbs
- Create a ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding for cluster-wide permissions
- Set up RBAC for a group of users rather than a single user
- Configure RBAC for a ServiceAccount to secure your application pods

Keep exploring Kubernetes RBAC to build secure and properly isolated environments!
